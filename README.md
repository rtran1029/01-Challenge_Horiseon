# 01 Challenge

**Version 1.2**

* I was able to take prewritten code and deployed semantic elements to make the source code more accesable
* I was able to clone original code, edit the code, 'add' changes, 'commit' changes with notes, and 'push' code back to my repo
* I was able to make a basic README.md file with a description of the assignment and an included screenshot of the page hosted on my github URL (https://rtran1029.github.io/01-Challenge_Horiseon/)
